This tutorial teaches ML analytics with a series of hands-on labs (HOLs) using the [Data Science](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/data-science.htm) service in [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com/).

You'll learn how to get data from some public data sources, then how to analyze this data using some of the latest ML techniques. In the process you'll build ML models and test them out in a predictor app.

## Getting Started

There is some infrastructure that must be deployed before you can enjoy this tutorial.  See the [Terraform documentation](./terraform/README.md) for more information.

After the OCI infrastructure is deployed, proceed with the [beginner's tutorial](./beginners/README.md) to start through the ML labs.

### Prerequisites

You must have an OCI account.  [Click here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/?source=:ow:o:s:nav::DevoGetStarted&intcmp=:ow:o:s:nav::DevoGetStarted) to create a new cloud account.

This solution is designed to work with several OCI services, allowing you to quickly be up-and-running:
* [Data Science](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/data-science.htm)
* [Resource Manager](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/landing.htm)

There are required OCI resources (see the [Terraform documentation](./terraform/README.md) for more information) that are needed for this tutorial.

## Notes/Issues
